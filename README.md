# numpy_python_ann
The point of this task is to develop a multi-layer neural network for classification using Python and Numpy:  Implement sigmoid and relu layers (with forward and backward pass) Implement a softmax output layer Implement a fully parameterizable neural network (number and types of layers, number of units) Implement an optimizer (e.g. SGD or Adam) and a stopping criterion of your choosing Train your Neural Network using backpropagation

# Instructions
You can either run the project by executing the main.py file or run the jupyter notebook that explains the code and some background theory.
